* implement PEC as material and check that we obtain Casimir's result correctly
* check that energy, force, and forcegradient are actually derivatives of each other
* implement high-temperature limit and check against analytical results
* check what happens if we coat with vacuum, does that just effectively change the separation?
* test reflection coefficients: pec on top will ignore everything under, thinner coating means reflection coefficient is smaller, etc.
